### Classification:
<strong>
In machine learning, classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.</strong><br>
<strong>Classification in machine learning and statistics is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data given to it and make new observations or classifications..
</strong>

### multi-class classifier:
<strong>A classifier that can predict a field with multiple discrete values, such as ”DrugA", ”DrugX" or "DrugY”.</strong>
<br><br><br>
classification can be used for email filtering, speech recognition, handwriting recognition, biometric identification, document classification and much more
<br>
<br>

## Here we have the types of classification algorithms and machine learning:<br>
### decision trees,
### naive bayes,
### linear discriminant analysis,
### k-nearest neighbor,
### logistic regression,
### neural networks,
### support vector machines.
