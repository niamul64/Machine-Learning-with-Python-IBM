<strong>The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a classification algorithm that takes a bunch of labeled points and uses them to learn how to label other points.This algorithm classifies cases based on their similarity to other cases.</strong><br><br> 
Here, k means number of neighbors we need to consider.

# to select best value of k:
<br>Here, k means number of neighbors we need to consider.<br>
start from k=1 <br>
and measure the accuracy<br>
now k=2<br>
and measure the accuracy<br> . . . . . . 
by this find the best accuracy and value of k
