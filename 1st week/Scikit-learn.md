<strong>SciKit Learn is a collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning</strong>
<br><br>
SciKit Learn has most of the classification, regression and clustering algorithms, and it's designed to work with a Python numerical and scientific <br>
libraries: NumPy and SciPy.<br>
<strong>implementing machine learning models with SciKit Learn is really easy with a few lines of Python code.</strong><br><br>
